# Timeline

Its a beautiful colored stem based Timeline

I originally downloaded the code form a [gist](https://gist.github.com/CodeMyUI/7e0c8dded4b11ae85f1b7e8e48e60cff) by [CodeMyUI](https://codemyui.com/responsive-timeline-animated-scroll-click/). 
Just added a php based less compiler that compiles LESS based stylesheet into CSS

I'm planning to work more on it to make it more useful and beautiful. All of you are also encouraged to fork and work on this repo if you have any enhancement ideas in your mind. Or alternatively you can share your ideas by creating a new Issue.
