# Timeline

Its a beautiful colored stem based Timeline

I originally downloaded the code form a [gist](https://gist.github.com/CodeMyUI/7e0c8dded4b11ae85f1b7e8e48e60cff) by [CodeMyUI](https://codemyui.com/responsive-timeline-animated-scroll-click/). 
Just added a php based less compiler and compiled LESS based stylesheet into CSS

All of you are encouraged to fork and contribute if you have some enhancements in your mind. I'm also work on it if get the time.
